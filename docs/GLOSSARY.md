## Glossary
* __Zeplin screens and components__ are two well defined data structures that contain enough information for any design to be implemented in any UI platform by a developer. Zeplin screens could also contain components.

* __Semantic UI code__ is the UI code introducing meaning of the elements in the design to the platform's markup language rather than just presentation. As an example, a `<h1>` tag gives the text it wraps around the meaning of "a top level heading on the page" in HTML.

* __React__ is a Javascript library for building user interfaces. It is generally used with an HTML like syntax called JSX.

* __React Native__ is a framework to build native mobile apps using Javascript and React. Although it specifically started as a way to build native mobile apps using Javascript; its' scope is extended to include other target platforms such as web, windows, mac etc.

* __React Native components__ are basic building blocks for a user interface such as
    - `View` - a component to separate parts of the UI
    - `Text` - a component to render text
    - `Image` - a component to render image
    - `StyleSheet` - a component to specify visual and layout properties of a component very similar to CSS StyleSheets.

With the help of these definitions; we can rephrase our aim as to translate a design represented by well defined data structures to JSX code with React Native components.
